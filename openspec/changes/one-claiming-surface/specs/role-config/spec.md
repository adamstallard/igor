## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Roles inherit an org-level base of the same shape

A role SHALL inherit from the base named in `extends`, defaulting to the org-level base. A base
SHALL use the identical file shape, so intermediate bases are possible without a second
artifact type.

`extends` SHALL name at most one base. A role naming two or more SHALL be refused, naming the
bases and saying how to build a role that spans several areas: give it its own lane and its own
`allow` and `commands`, and share what roles have in common through an intermediate base.

A role with two bases would take whatever both allow, so a change to either base would change
what it may do without its own file or its single line of ancestors changing, and nobody
reviewing that change would see the role it widened. Two bases would also have to be reconciled
on every field where the last level wins, such as `completion`. With one base, a role's own file
and its ancestors say all it may do.

#### Scenario: Org base inherited

- **WHEN** a role extends the org base and declares no completion action of its own
- **THEN** the org base's completion action applies

#### Scenario: Intermediate base composed

- **WHEN** a role extends a base that itself extends the org base
- **THEN** values resolve through the whole chain

#### Scenario: Two bases refused

- **WHEN** a role declares `extends: [backend, frontend]`
- **THEN** the role is refused, naming both bases
- **AND** the refusal says to give a role spanning both areas its own lane and permissions,
  extending a shared base

#### Scenario: A role spanning two areas through one base

- **WHEN** `fullstack` extends `engineering`, which extends the org base, and declares a lane
  covering both the frontend and backend paths, with its own `allow` and `commands`
- **THEN** the role loads
- **AND** a later change to a `frontend` role extending `engineering` does not change what
  `fullstack` may do

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: An Igor holds exactly one role

An Igor SHALL hold exactly one role, and its identity on every surface SHALL be that role: a
GitHub App on GitHub, and an app user on Linear. A person reading a
claim sees which role took the item, and hands work to a role by naming it. Igors of different
roles MAY draw on the same seat, since a seat is capacity and not an identity.

Processes running the same role under the same identity are one Igor and are interchangeable.

#### Scenario: Two roles are two Igors

- **WHEN** an organization wants backend and frontend work done
- **THEN** it runs a `backend` Igor and a `frontend` Igor, each with its own identity
- **AND** both may reference the same seat

#### Scenario: A claim names the role

- **WHEN** an Igor claims an item
- **THEN** the identity in the holder field, or the `igor:<role>` label, names that Igor's role

#### Scenario: More processes of one role are one Igor

- **WHEN** three processes run the `backend` role under the `backend` identity
- **THEN** they are one Igor
- **AND** a claim made by any of them names the same identity
