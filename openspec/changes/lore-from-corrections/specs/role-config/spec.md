## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Merge semantics differ by field kind

Inheritance SHALL apply three merge semantics, selected per field:

The `allow` vocabulary is a **closed set**, so a typo fails validation rather than silently
granting nothing: `comment`, `review-comment`, `draft-pr`, `pr`, `label`, `assign`, `unassign`,
`close`, `merge`, `send`, `propose-lore`. The safe default an org base should ship with is
`[draft-pr, comment]` — everything reversible, nothing final.

- **Monotonic** for permission-shaped fields (`allow`, `commands`, `budget_share`,
  repositories and surfaces in reach): a role MAY restrict what it inherits and MUST NOT
  widen it.
- **Override** for settings (`completion`, poll interval): the most specific level wins.
- **Append** for `instructions` and `lane`: levels accumulate, with lane constraints conjoined.

#### Scenario: Role narrows a permission

- **WHEN** the org base allows `[draft-pr, comment]` and a role allows `[comment]`
- **THEN** the role's effective allow list is `[comment]`

#### Scenario: Role attempting to widen a permission is rejected

- **WHEN** the org base allows `[comment]` and a role allows `[draft-pr, comment]`
- **THEN** validation fails, because widening an inherited permission is self-escalation

#### Scenario: Role attempting to widen its commands is rejected

- **WHEN** the org base permits the command `npm test` and a role also declares `npm install`
- **THEN** validation fails, for the reason widening `allow` fails: a role that can grant
  itself a command can grant itself every command

#### Scenario: Setting overridden

- **WHEN** the org base sets `completion: unassign` and a role sets `completion: close`
- **THEN** the role's effective completion action is `close`

#### Scenario: Instructions accumulate

- **WHEN** both the org base and a role declare `instructions`
- **THEN** both texts apply to the worker

#### Scenario: Org lane exclusion is inescapable

- **WHEN** the org base excludes label `Human` and a role declares its own lane
- **THEN** the effective lane still excludes `Human`
- **AND** no role-level declaration can remove it, because lane constraints are conjoined
