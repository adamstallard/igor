# A search over lore may be offered, and never shows an out-of-scope entry

## Decisions

All twelve decisions are Adam's, and
[#215](https://github.com/adamstallard/igor/issues/215) records each one. A *consistency read*
is a check, by a fresh agent, of this change against every other spec, change and open pull
request; Adam answered the questions each read raised. He made:
- decisions 1, 2 and 7 on 2026-10-19, while reviewing
  [shared-skills #25](https://github.com/adamstallard/shared-skills/pull/25);
- decisions 3 to 6 on 2026-10-20, answering this change's first consistency read;
- the first paragraph of decision 8 on 2026-10-20, while reviewing shared-skills #25;
- the second paragraphs of decisions 3, 6 and 8, and decisions 9 to 11, on 2026-10-20,
  answering the questions that this change's second to fourth consistency reads raised;
- decision 12 on 2026-10-20. The agent that wrote this change proposed it, and Adam approved
  it without changes;
- later on 2026-10-20, after decisions 9 to 11, that a citation file takes the format
  shared-skills #25 defines (decisions 110 and 111 in #25's proposal, both Adam's). Decision 10
  now points to that format instead of stating its own.

Terms used here:
- An *Igor* is a teammate agent that runs one role. A *worker* is the agent an Igor starts to do
  one item, and *during an Igor's run* means while an agent works for an Igor under its role.
- The *inquisitor* is a shared skill (shared-skills #25) that an agent runs before asking a
  person a question. Its first filter looks for an *answer*: something already recorded that
  settles the question, so that no person need be asked.
- A *citation* is an agent's record that a lore entry answered a question.
- *Gate one* is this specification. *Gate two* is the code, which lands on the same branch once
  Adam approves gate one.

1. **Lore still reaches the worker unbidden.** Active, in-scope entries are injected before the
   worker runs, and the worker is never required to request them.
2. **The ban on offering a search over the lore store is dropped.** The ban's only stated reason
   is that a worker needs no search. `docs/architecture.md` §3.2.1 justifies unbidden firing by
   saying that better search cannot replace it, not that search does harm; of letting a worker
   search Linear or Slack, the same section says "forbidding it buys no safety".
3. **Scope is a hard filter on a search; status is not.** During an Igor's run, a search never
   returns an entry whose scope does not cover the run's role, nor any count or mention of one,
   because scope decides what a role may see (*Status and scope are exact filters, always
   applied*). A search may return an in-scope `provisional` or `deprecated` entry, labelled as
   not lore. Only `active` entries count as lore or as answers. Status filters firing only,
   because it is review state: an unreviewed or retired entry can still inform an agent, as long
   as nobody takes it for reviewed lore.

   A search result is not injected lore. It comes back to the agent as search output, labelled,
   and never in the trusted channel that carries injected lore. So `lore-from-corrections`'
   promise that no worker receives a `provisional` candidate until a person merges it, which is
   about injection, still holds while a search shows that candidate labelled as not lore.
4. **During an Igor's run, a search uses firing's scope rule for the run's role.** That is
   `scopeMatches` in `src/firing.ts`: `global`, `role:` naming the running role, and `project:`
   naming any repository the role works. This holds when the inquisitor skill runs inside an
   Igor, and shared-skills #25 adopts the same rule for that case (its decision 64). A search
   outside an Igor's run, such as the inquisitor in a person's own session, has no run's role to
   filter by, and this change sets no rule for it; the inquisitor's own spec, in shared-skills
   #25, does.
5. **A search hit is not a firing.** It is not recorded as one and gets no counter of its own.
   For deciding whether an entry is used, the event that counts is an agent citing the entry as
   the answer to a question, because then no person had to be asked. A review that proposes
   pruning or promotion (`docs/architecture.md` §3.4.1, still planned, with no thresholds)
   counts those citations beside the fire count, reading them as decision 8 says. An entry can
   be cited but never fire, for example while its role's in-scope entries exceed the firing
   budget, and it is then not proposed as unused.
6. **A search is a lookup over the store made to find lore or an answer for an agent.** A check
   that compares a candidate against the store to avoid a duplicate, as `lore-from-corrections`
   and `lore-from-reviews` do, is curation and not a search. It may compare against `provisional`
   entries, and against candidates a reviewer has already rejected (`lore-from-corrections` never
   proposes one of those again). Scope is a hard filter there too, by the role of the Igor running
   the check. A person reading the store, as `igor list` lets them, is not a search either:
   reviewing entries requires seeing the `provisional` ones.

   Checking that a candidate's id is free is not a duplicate check. `lore-review`'s id gate, and
   minting an id, still check against every entry and rejection in the store. During a run, a
   collision with an entry or rejected candidate outside the run's role's scope is reported only
   as "id taken", without naming what holds the id or saying whether it is an entry or a
   rejection. A rejection that records no scope counts as outside the run's role's scope, for
   the id gate and for a duplicate check alike. This rule has a limit, which nothing in this
   change closes: an id is derived from its claim, so "id taken" still tells the run that
   something outside its scope makes that claim.
7. **No carve-out for one caller.** *Rejected:* allowing only the inquisitor's search. The one
   harm a search could do is show a role entries it may not see, and decision 3 prevents that for
   every caller.
8. **A review reads an entry's citations from the lore repository's `questions` branch.** That
   branch is an orphan branch of the lore repository, separate from igor's `igor-state`, holding
   the inquisitor's questions about the organization and its projects. Shared-skills #25 moves
   those questions there (its decision 42), and writes citations there. When the inquisitor
   finds the answer to a question in a lore entry, so that nobody is asked, a citation of that
   entry goes to that branch, within the limits decisions 9 and 10 set. *Rejected:* counting
   citations in the inquisitor's per-repository question logs, which are scattered across
   repositories, some of them worked by no Igor role.

   Where the branch is missing or holds no citation, the review reports citations as not
   checked, never as zero, and proposes no entry as unused. Otherwise its count is a lower bound,
   and the review says so beside the count. Missing from it are the citations the Igor refused,
   withheld or could not push, and every citation from a run that published neither an artifact
   nor a handoff (decision 9).
9. **During an Igor's run, the worker reports each citation in its output, and the Igor pushes
   it.** The Igor pushes the citations to the `questions` branch, as the rest of the design has
   it: *worker edits, Igor publishes*. The worker gets no credential for the lore repository.
   Because the worker's output is untrusted, the Igor pushes a citation only of an existing
   `active` entry in the run's role's scope. It counts every citation it does not push, by
   reason: refused for its entry, held back for a categorized question, withheld by the visibility
   rule in decision 10, failed to push, or from a run that published nothing.

   The Igor pushes a run's citations only when the run publishes an artifact, or ends in the
   Igor's handoff comment on the item (`graceful-handoff`; #211 calls one over an unsettled
   question a handback). A run that publishes neither pushes no citations. Pushing them is
   bookkeeping, like the firing record and the transcripts on the state branch, so the role's
   `allow` list does not govern it; `task-execution`'s *Only reversible artifacts are produced*
   says so. *Rejected:* a new `allow` action for citations.
10. **A citation file takes the one format shared-skills #25 defines,** in its requirement
    *A citation file has one format* (#25's decisions 110 and 111). This change points to that
    requirement and does not state a format of its own. As #25 states it, the file holds the
    cited entry's id, the date and, for a citation an Igor pushes from a run, the run's id, with no text or hash of
    the question and no person's identity. The run's id is an opaque identifier the Igor
    records with the run's transcript on the state branch, so a review can find the run and its
    item there (decision 11). A question categorized as a vulnerability, a secret or personal
    sends no citation at all, to match shared-skills #25, which sends none for such questions.

    No citation goes to a place more visible than the repository the question concerns, where
    private is less visible than internal and internal less than public. A citation tells its
    readers that work on that repository needed the entry, and when; the cited entry also shows
    what the question was about. This rule is Adam's, given for the inquisitor and for this
    change alike; shared-skills #25 states it for the inquisitor's citations. A lore repository
    whose visibility cannot be read counts as public, and a concerned repository whose
    visibility cannot be read counts as private. During a run, the repository the question
    concerns is the repository of the item the run works, never one the worker names.
11. **A forged citation is a known limit.** Item text can steer a worker, and a steered worker
    could report citations of any `active` entry in its role's scope, which would keep that
    entry from being proposed as unused. It could also leave out a question's category, and then
    a citation is pushed for a question that should send none; the file still holds only the
    entry's id, the date and the run's id. A review shows each citation's run and item, so the
    person reviewing a prune proposal can judge it. Prune proposals are always reviewed by a
    person, and nothing else guards against a forged citation.
12. **How the Igor dates, pushes and records citations.** Approved by Adam (2026-10-20), as
    the agent that wrote this change proposed it:
    - The citation's date is the date the Igor pushes it, since the worker's output is
      untrusted.
    - The Igor creates the `questions` branch, as an orphan, where it is missing. Shared-skills
      #25 may create it first.
    - A push rejected because the branch moved is retried on the branch's new tip.
    - The Igor records only counts, by reason, of the citations it did not push.
      The record never repeats worker text or says why a citation was refused, so it cannot
      reveal an out-of-scope entry.
    - The run's id is opaque, rather than the item's repository and number. Two private
      repositories can have different readers, so an item reference in a private lore
      repository could show a repository's name to people who cannot read it.

**Still open:**
- Whether gate two builds a search command for workers. Either way, gate two builds and tests
  the filter a search must use (tasks.md, section 2).
- Whether an Igor's worker can run the inquisitor skill at all: load it, and reach a lore clone
  and the skill's configuration from the worker's environment, which Igor writes out for each
  worker rather than letting it inherit the server's. Open pull request
  [#174](https://github.com/adamstallard/igor/pull/174) decides which skills a worker loads, and
  [#175](https://github.com/adamstallard/igor/pull/175) changes what the worker may touch. Task
  4.1 checks once both and shared-skills #25 have landed.
- Whether a worker can read the lore checkout's files directly. If it can, it can see entries
  outside its role's scope without any search, and the filter above does not stop that. #175
  requires only that the worker cannot write the checkout, so task 4.2 still checks reading.
- Shared-skills #25 carries the firing scope rule inside an Igor (decision 4), the `questions`
  branch and citations (decision 8), and has not merged. Until it merges, nobody should rely on
  the inquisitor's search during a run, and task 4.1 checks whether a worker can run that search
  before anyone does. Citations made outside a run are not written until then, so a review's
  count misses them.
- The citation-file format is defined only in shared-skills #25, in its requirement *A
  citation file has one format*, and #25 has not merged. This change's requirement *An Igor
  publishes the citations its worker reports* links to it on #25's branch. Until #25 merges,
  gate two builds the format as #25's branch states it, and follows any change #25 makes to it.
  Archive this change only after #25 merges, and then point the link at the requirement in
  shared-skills' `openspec/specs/inquisitor/spec.md`.
- [#153](https://github.com/adamstallard/igor/pull/153) (`signed-publishing`) requires skill
  trailers on every commit an Igor makes for a role that lists those skills. A citation commit
  is bookkeeping, like a commit to the state branch, and carries none: shared-skills #25's
  format, which also fixes the citation's commit, gives it no trailer. Reported to #153, which
  may want to exempt bookkeeping commits; this change does not edit it.
- `lore-from-corrections` adds provenance to an existing entry when a correction restates its
  rule, rather than proposing a duplicate. Under decision 6, a duplicate check during a run
  cannot see an entry outside the run's role's scope, so a correction restating such an entry's
  rule would be proposed as a new entry. That change may want to narrow its scenario; this
  change does not edit it.
- `lore-from-corrections` says no worker *receives* a `provisional` candidate until a person
  merges it, and that nothing it proposes *reaches* a worker unreviewed. Decision 3 reads that
  promise as being about injection. That change may want to narrow its wording to say so; this
  change does not edit it.
- Whether the lore repository's rulesets or branch protection let an Igor's App create and push
  the orphan `questions` branch. `surface-adapter` already requires the App to hold Contents
  write on the lore repository. Task 4.3 checks. Until it can, every citation the Igor tries to
  push is counted as not pushed, and the branch holds none, so a review reports citations as
  not checked.

## Why

The requirement *Lore reaches the worker unbidden* forbids offering a worker a search over the
store, because a worker needs no search: anything it would think to look up is reachable by
reading the codebase. Two cases contradict that:

- **Firing does not always deliver every entry.** When the in-scope entries exceed the token
  budget, none are injected (*Exceeding the budget is reported, never silently resolved*), and
  the relevance mechanism that the budget requirement anticipates would inject only some. A
  search lets a worker find a recorded answer that was not injected.
- **The inquisitor searches lore before an agent asks a person anything.** The shared
  `inquisitor` skill (shared-skills #25) runs filters before an agent asks a question, and the
  first looks for an answer already recorded, in lore among other places.
  [#211](https://github.com/adamstallard/igor/issues/211)'s decision 9 has an Igor run those
  filters when a question it cannot settle stops its work, so an Igor would search lore before
  asking anyone. That search avoids interrupting a person; it is not looking up how to do the
  work, which is all the ban's reason speaks to.

## What Changes

- `lore-firing`'s *Lore reaches the worker unbidden* keeps injection, now saying it happens
  whenever the entries fit the firing budget, and drops the ban on a search.
- The same requirement defines a search, a search during a run, and when a scope covers a role.
  It holds a search during a run to firing's scope rule, lets it return in-scope entries that
  are not `active` with a label, keeps its results out of the injected-lore channel and out of
  the firing record, and says what a duplicate check may compare against.
- The scenario *No search affordance offered* is removed. Six are added: *Injection does not
  wait on a search*, *A search never shows an out-of-scope entry*, *A search labels in-scope
  entries that are not active*, *Search results never arrive as injected lore*, *A search hit
  is not a firing*, and *A duplicate check is curation, not a search*.
- A new `lore-firing` requirement, *An Igor publishes the citations its worker reports*, says
  who writes a citation during a run, which citations it accepts, what the file holds, where it
  may go, and that a citation it refuses, withholds or cannot push is reported. It sits in
  `lore-firing` beside *What fired is recorded on the state branch*, the other record of an
  entry's use. For the file's format, it points to shared-skills #25's *A citation file has one
  format* instead of stating its own.
- `task-execution`'s *Only reversible artifacts are produced* exempts pushing a run's citations
  from the role's `allow` list, with one new scenario.
- `lore-review`'s *An entry already in the store is never overwritten by proposing* reports an
  out-of-scope collision during a run only as "id taken", with one new scenario.
- `docs/architecture.md`: §3.3 says a search may be offered and what binds it, §3.4.1 says a
  search hit is not a firing and that a review counts citations from the lore repository's
  `questions` branch, and §4.1 says the worker never *has* to search.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `lore-firing`: *Lore reaches the worker unbidden* allows a search over the store and says what
  a search may return. A new requirement has the Igor publish its worker's citations.
- `lore-review`: an id collision with an out-of-scope entry or rejection, during a run, is
  reported without naming it.
- `task-execution`: pushing a run's citations is exempt from the role's `allow` list.

## Impact

- `test/firing.test.ts`: the test *offers a worker no way to search the store* checks the removed
  scenario, and is deleted in gate two.
- `src/firing.ts`: its header comment gives the old reason for having no search, and is rewritten
  in gate two.
- [#196](https://github.com/adamstallard/igor/pull/196) (`spec-trace`) tags that test with
  `@scenario lore-firing: No search affordance offered`. Whichever of #196 and this change
  merges second removes the tag with the test.
- `lore-from-corrections` and `lore-from-reviews` each compare a candidate against existing
  entries, and neither limits that by scope. Where such a check runs during an Igor's run, it
  must not compare against an entry outside the role's scope (decision 6).
- `lore-from-corrections` says no worker receives a `provisional` candidate until a person
  merges it. That promise is about injection, and a search result is not injected (decision 3),
  so the change leaves it as written.
