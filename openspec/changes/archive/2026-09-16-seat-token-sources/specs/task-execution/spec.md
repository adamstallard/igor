## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The worker is given an explicit environment holding no credential but its seat's

Execution SHALL construct the worker's environment rather than inheriting the Igor's, and that
environment SHALL carry no credential other than the token of the seat the work is charged to.
The tokens of other seats, and the credential the Igor acts on its surfaces with, MUST NOT be
present. Where the chosen seat names a token source that cannot be read — an unset variable, an
unreadable or empty file, a command that fails, prints nothing, or never returns — execution
SHALL fail naming it rather than spawning a worker that authenticates as something else.

The worker needs none of them. It edits files in a disposable tree; claiming, commenting,
branching and publishing all happen in the loop afterwards, with the loop's own credentials. An
inherited environment is therefore a set of credentials nothing in the worker has a use for,
one shell command away from a worker an item's text has steered.

Only what running a toolchain requires is passed: the search path, a home directory, and the
network settings the host is configured with. None of those is a credential, and each fails as
something else entirely when it is missing.

#### Scenario: The surface credential is absent

- **WHEN** a worker is spawned while the Igor holds a code-host token
- **THEN** that token is not in the worker's environment

#### Scenario: Only the chosen seat's token is present

- **WHEN** several seats are declared and one is chosen for an item
- **THEN** that seat's token is in the worker's environment
- **AND** no other seat's token is

#### Scenario: A seat whose token variable is unset fails loudly

- **WHEN** the chosen seat names a token variable that is not set
- **THEN** execution fails naming the variable
- **AND** no worker is spawned

#### Scenario: A seat whose file or command yields no token fails loudly

- **WHEN** the chosen seat names a file that cannot be read or is empty, or a command that
  fails, prints nothing, or is killed at its timeout
- **THEN** execution fails naming what was tried and why
- **AND** no worker is spawned

#### Scenario: A toolchain still runs

- **WHEN** a worker runs a build or a test in its working tree
- **THEN** the search path, home directory and network settings it needs are present
