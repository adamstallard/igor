## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: An item held by another party is never a candidate

Triage SHALL skip any item whose holder field names a party other than the running Igor. This
rule is universal and MUST NOT be configurable.

Acting on work that is visibly someone else's is not an organizational preference. Left to a
lane, an org that forgets to write it gets an Igor that claims and retracts on a colleague's
issue every cycle — noise directed at exactly the people a claim exists to inform.

#### Scenario: An item someone else holds is skipped before any claim

- **WHEN** a candidate is held by a party other than the running Igor
- **THEN** triage skips it before any model call and before any claim
- **AND** the reason recorded names who holds it

#### Scenario: A second holder alongside the Igor still means someone else's

- **WHEN** a candidate is held by both the running Igor and another party
- **THEN** it is skipped, on the same reading a mid-run claim check uses: people add
  themselves to a holder list rather than replacing what is there

#### Scenario: An item the Igor itself holds is still a candidate

- **WHEN** a candidate is held only by the running Igor and has no work in flight
- **THEN** it is not skipped, because that is a claim left behind by a process that stopped

#### Scenario: Nobody named means nobody holds it

- **WHEN** a candidate names no holder
- **THEN** the skip does not apply

### Requirement: An item handed back is not re-worked until something answers

Where an Igor has handed an item back rather than producing something, that outcome SHALL be
recorded, and the item SHALL NOT be worked again while nothing has answered it.

An Igor's own handoff comment moves the item's timestamp past the watermark, so the item looks
fresh next cycle. Nothing else stops it: the claim was released, no pull request exists, the
lane still admits it and the model gives the same verdict on the same text. The Igor re-claims
and re-works it every poll interval, at full worker cost, forever.

An answer is anything that could change the outcome: a reply from anyone other than the Igor,
or an edit to the item itself. Both are required, because a handoff *invites* a reply — an item
suppressed until its title or labels change would stay silent precisely where a person supplied
the missing context in a comment.

#### Scenario: A handed-back item does not return unanswered

- **WHEN** an item was handed back and nothing has been said on it since, and the item itself
  is unchanged
- **THEN** it is not worked again

#### Scenario: The Igor's own handoff does not make an item fresh

- **WHEN** the only activity since the handoff is the Igor's own message
- **THEN** that alone does not make the item workable again

#### Scenario: A reply lifts the suppression

- **WHEN** anyone other than the Igor comments on a handed-back item
- **THEN** it is worked again

#### Scenario: An edit lifts the suppression

- **WHEN** a handed-back item is retitled, rewritten, relabelled, or its holder changes
- **THEN** it is worked again, whether or not anyone commented

#### Scenario: Running out of budget is not a decision about the item

- **WHEN** an item was handed back because the budget was exhausted
- **THEN** it is not suppressed, because nothing about the item produced that outcome

#### Scenario: The record is a cache, not a source of truth

- **WHEN** the record is missing or unreadable
- **THEN** the item is worked again rather than the cycle failing
