## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Work finished before a claim is lost is offered, not discarded

Where a claim is found to be gone between the worker finishing and publication, execution SHALL
distinguish a stop from a loss. A stop SHALL publish nothing. A loss SHALL publish what exists
as a draft, request no reviewers, and leave a message naming what exists.

Someone taking an item over is saying they are taking it, not that the work so far should be
destroyed. The working tree is disposable by design, so discarding it at this point is
unrecoverable: the transcript records that a change was made and not the change itself.

An Igor that has lost an item must not then appear in anyone's review queue over it, which is
why nothing is requested of the new holder.

#### Scenario: A stop still publishes nothing

- **WHEN** the claim was stopped during execution
- **THEN** nothing is published
- **AND** the refusal names the stop

#### Scenario: A loss publishes a draft

- **WHEN** another party holds the item by the time the worker finishes
- **THEN** what the worker produced is published as a draft
- **AND** no reviewers are requested

#### Scenario: The new holder is told what exists

- **WHEN** work is published after a claim was lost
- **THEN** a message on the item names the artifact and says it is theirs to keep, continue, or
  discard

#### Scenario: A role that may not publish still may not

- **WHEN** a claim is lost and the role's allow list permits no pull request
- **THEN** nothing is published, and the refusal is recorded as it would be otherwise

#### Scenario: Losing a claim does not complete the item

- **WHEN** work is published after a claim was lost
- **THEN** the configured completion behaviour is not performed, because the item is not the
  Igor's to complete
