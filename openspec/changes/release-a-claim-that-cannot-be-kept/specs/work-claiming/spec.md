## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A claim that cannot be kept is given back, out loud

`work-claiming` says how a claim is taken, verified, stood down from and stopped. It says nothing
about the run that takes one and then cannot continue, and that silence is the gap: an Igor that
throws while holding a claim leaves the item assigned, other people told to stand off, and no
explanation.

Where a run holds a claim and cannot go on — the claim could not be finished, or anything after it
failed — the Igor SHALL release the claim and say so on the item. It SHALL NOT end such a run
holding the claim in silence.

**Where the release does not succeed either**, the Igor SHALL say that instead of saying it
released. The item still carries the Igor's name, so a message asserting release would be false
where somebody is looking; what is said SHALL name the item as still held and SHALL name the one
action that frees it.

**A failure of the surface is not a failure of the item.** Where a run ends this way because a
tracker or host did not answer, that SHALL be distinguishable from a refusal about the item
itself, and a cycle meeting **two in a row** SHALL stop rather than attempting the remaining
items. Nothing about the item produced the outcome, so every remaining item would reach the same
one — and doing so speaks on each of them, at a volume that is itself a cause of the failure.

Two, not one, because the run cannot tell the two causes apart: `produce` fails inside the worker
call for a branch the item already owns, while a tracker that does not answer the completion
unassign fails outside it, so neither the error nor how far the run got separates them. How many items they
affect does — an outage fails every item and a bad item fails one — so the count is the
distinction. A cycle that met one and then ran an item cleanly did not fail, and SHALL NOT be
recorded as failed.

**A write says what the surface recorded.** Where the Igor asks a surface to say or to release
something, the answer SHALL carry what was recorded, not merely that no error was raised. A raised
error cannot separate *this did not happen* from *this happened and the answer was lost*, and a
caller that must tell them apart cannot do it from a thrown error alone.

#### Scenario: A claim that could not be announced is given back

- **WHEN** a claim is recorded and the message announcing it fails
- **THEN** the claim is released and the run is refused
- **AND** the item is not left assigned with nothing said

#### Scenario: A claim that could not be verified is given back and withdrawn

- **WHEN** a claim was announced and verifying it fails
- **THEN** the claim is released, the announcement is withdrawn on the item, and the run is refused

#### Scenario: A release that did not take is said so

- **WHEN** a claim cannot be kept and releasing it does not clear the holder
- **THEN** what is said names the item as still held rather than as released
- **AND** it names the action that frees it

#### Scenario: A failure after the claim hands the item back

- **WHEN** a run holding a claim fails at any point after taking it
- **THEN** the claim is handed back with an explanation on the item

#### Scenario: A cycle stops when the surface stops answering

- **WHEN** two runs in a row end because a surface did not answer
- **THEN** the cycle is recorded as failed and the remaining items are not attempted

#### Scenario: One run ending that way does not stop the cycle

- **WHEN** an item's run ends because a surface did not answer and the next item's run does not
- **THEN** the cycle continues and is not recorded as failed

#### Scenario: A refusal about the item does not stop the cycle

- **WHEN** a claim is refused because the tracker did not record it
- **THEN** the cycle continues to the remaining items
